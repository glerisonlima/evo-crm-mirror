# Regression guard for the agent role permission set seeded by
# db/seeds/rbac.rb. A misadjusted permission key here silently changes what
# every default agent in every fresh install can do — the seed runs
# `destroy_all` then re-creates from the array, so the on-disk array is the
# source of truth at install time. The agent role specifically came up in
# the PR #14 review of EVO-1060: `pipelines.update` had been added under the
# assumption it was required for kanban drag-and-drop, but the controller
# only checks `pipelines.read`. `pipelines.update` would also have unlocked
# destructive endpoints (archive, set_as_default, rename of shared
# pipelines) without product authorisation. This spec exists so the same
# slip cannot recur unnoticed.
