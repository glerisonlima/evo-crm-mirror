# frozen_string_literal: true

# Paired data-migration for the RBAC catalog hygiene story (EVO-2070).
#
# resource_actions_config.rb dropped 16 dead/duplicated resources and
# consolidated two into survivors. On a fresh install db/seeds/rbac.rb already
# reflects the trimmed catalog; existing (already-bootstrapped) installations
# skip the seed, so their role_permissions_actions rows still carry grants for
# keys that are no longer valid. Those rows are harmless at runtime (the gate
# only ever asks about catalog keys) but they linger in the DB and would fail
# any future find_or_create_by! against the now-stricter validation. This
# migration reconciles the stored grants with the trimmed catalog.
#
# What `up` does, using delete_all/update to BYPASS the permission_key
# validation (the old keys are already invalid against the catalog):
#   1) Rewrite consolidated keys (team_members.* -> teams.*, permissions.read ->
#      roles.read). The rewrite is unique-index-safe: `index_role_perms_actions_unique`
#      is on (role_id, permission_key), so for a role that already holds the
#      target key we DELETE the stale row instead of updating it into a
#      duplicate; roles missing the target get an in-place UPDATE. Several old
#      keys collapse onto teams.update — processing the renames in order keeps
#      each step consistent with the rows the previous step produced.
#   2) Delete grants for the fully removed resources, matched by key prefix.
#
# super_admin/account_owner keep every real capability: teams.read/teams.update
# and roles.read all survive in the catalog, so the consolidation only trades
# names, never access. The removed prefixes gate nothing that is still routed.
#
# `down` is intentionally a NON-REVERSIBLE no-op: the removed/renamed grants
# referenced keys that no longer exist in the catalog, so re-adding them would
# reintroduce invalid rows. Re-running db/seeds/rbac.rb is the supported repair
# after any rollback.
