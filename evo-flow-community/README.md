## About

**Evo Flow** is the automation engine of the Evo CRM Community. Built on NestJS 11, it orchestrates journeys (via Temporal workflows), evaluates segments (on ClickHouse), schedules and executes campaigns, ingests events (via Kafka), and tracks short-link clicks.

It is designed as a stateless application service that integrates with the rest of the Evo CRM Community stack:
- **`evo-auth-service-community`** issues and validates Bearer tokens — Evo Flow does not perform login itself.
- **`evo-ai-crm-community`** is the source-of-truth for contacts, labels, users and custom attributes — Evo Flow reads through the CRM REST API.
- **Postgres** stores journeys, segments, campaigns and short-links definitions.
- **ClickHouse** stores high-volume event data and computes segment membership.
- **Kafka** is the queue backbone for event ingestion and campaign batches.
- **Redis** handles caching and short-term coordination.
- **Temporal** powers journey workflow orchestration.

## Part of the Evo CRM Community

Evo Flow is part of the [Evo CRM Community](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community) ecosystem maintained by Evolution Foundation. To use the full stack, clone the umbrella repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community.git
```

The Community Edition is **single-account** by design — no multi-tenancy at the application layer. Account scoping is handled upstream by `evo-auth-service-community` via JWT claims.

## Features

### Journeys
- Visual flow orchestration via [Temporal](https://temporal.io)
- 20+ action nodes (add label, send message, conditional, wait, webhook, etc.)
- Variable interpolation and environment manager
- Per-session execution tracking and bulk operations

### Segments
- ClickHouse-backed segment computation
- Distributed segment workers via Kafka
- Real-time and cron-based recomputation modes
- Contact-level segment membership queries

### Campaigns

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 22+
- **PostgreSQL** 15+
- **ClickHouse** 24+
- **Redis** 7+
- **Kafka** 3.7+ (with Zookeeper)
- **Temporal** 1.24+

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:evolution-foundation/evo-flow.git
cd evo-flow

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment (see .env.example)
cp .env.example .env

# Run database migrations
npm run migration:run

# Start in development mode
npm run dev
```

The service will be available at `http://localhost:3334`.

### API documentation

Once running, Swagger UI is available at:

```
http://localhost:3334/api
```

### Frozen event names

The `event` field on `POST /api/v1/events/track` and the optional `eventName` on `POST /api/v1/events/identify` must be one of the strings in [`src/modules/events/event-names.enum.ts`](./src/modules/events/event-names.enum.ts) (`EVENT_NAMES`). Other values return HTTP 400 from the global `ValidationPipe`. The list is the contract with the CRM publisher (`lib/events/evo_flow_event_names.rb` in `evo-ai-crm-community`); a CI script (`scripts/check-event-names-sync.sh` at the monorepo root) blocks PRs that diverge.

**Growing the list:** adding or removing an entry requires **three coordinated edits in the same PR**: the Ruby file, the TS file, and the `EXPECTED_COUNT` constant in `scripts/check-event-names-sync.sh`. Otherwise the sync job fails with `DIVERGENT — lists match each other but count is N (expected M)`.

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example` for the complete list):

```bash
# Service
PORT=3334
RUN_MODE=single                 # single | api | event-worker | segment-worker | temporal-worker | campaign-worker

# Postgres (shared with evo-ai-crm-community)
POSTGRES_DB_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_DB_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB_USERNAME=postgres
POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB_DATABASE=evo_community

# ClickHouse
CLICKHOUSE_HOST=localhost
CLICKHOUSE_PORT=8123
CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE=evo_campaign
CLICKHOUSE_USERNAME=default
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=

# Kafka
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:9092

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# Temporal

EVOAI_CRM_API_TOKEN=<service-to-service-token>
AUTH_APIKEY_INTEGRATION_LOCAL=<service-to-service-token>
```

## Run Modes

Evo Flow can run as a single process (all-in-one for development) or as separate workers (recommended for production). `RUN_MODE` is validated at boot — an invalid value fails fast with the list of valid options. For example, `RUN_MODE=foo npm run dev` exits non-zero with:

```
Error: Invalid RUN_MODE='foo'. Valid values: single, api, event-worker, segment-worker, temporal-worker, campaign-worker, campaign-packer, campaign-sender, event-receiver, event-process.
```

Unsetting `RUN_MODE` defaults to `single`; an empty string (`RUN_MODE=`) is rejected with a separate message so accidental misconfigurations don't fall back silently.

Consolidated modes (production-ready today):

```bash
npm run dev:single      # everything in one process (default for local dev)
npm run dev:api         # HTTP API gateway only
npm run dev:event       # event-worker (Kafka consumer)
npm run dev:segment     # segment-worker (ClickHouse computation)
npm run dev:temporal    # temporal-worker (journey workflows)
npm run dev:campaign    # campaign-worker (audience + sender)
```

Distributed pipeline modes (EVO-1194 — names reserved, modules pending. Each one currently logs and exits 0 so docker-compose / k8s manifests can reference them):

```bash
npm run dev:campaign-packer    # campaign-packer  — audience materialization stage
npm run dev:campaign-sender    # campaign-sender  — dispatch stage
npm run dev:event-receiver     # event-receiver   — inbound webhook receiver
npm run dev:event-process      # event-process    — broker-driven event processor
```

### `dev:single` and the `kill-backend` step

`dev:single` is `npm run kill-backend && RUN_MODE=single npm run dev`. The
`kill-backend` step clears leftover "production-style" backend processes
(`node dist/main`, `node dist/main.js`, or the watch build `node … dist/main.js`)
before Nest boots, using:

```bash
pkill -u "$(id -u)" -f '[n]ode .*dist/(src/)?main(\.js)?( |$)'
```

- The `[n]` class makes the pattern match a real `node …` process but **not** the
  literal `[n]ode …` text in `pkill`'s own command line — so the script does not kill
  its own `sh -c` parent (this was bug EVO-1609: `dev:single` aborted with `Terminated`
  before boot). The self-exclusion protects the immediate shell; a wrapper that echoes
  the literal command (e.g. `set -x` / CI logs) can still match.
- `-u "$(id -u)"` scopes the scan to your own processes — it won't kill backends owned
  by other users or by containers sharing the host PID namespace.
- `(src/)?` is defensive: Evo Flow's `nest build` emits `dist/main.js` (tsc strips the
  `src/` root), but the optional branch keeps the pattern matching a `dist/src/main.js`
  layout too (the sibling evo-campaign scaffold / a future monorepo build).
- `main(\.js)?( |$)` blocks lookalikes such as `dist/maintenance.js` / `dist/main-old.js`.

Read-only preview of what `kill-backend` would target — should list only real
`node …dist/…main` processes, never the shell running the command:

```bash
pgrep -af '[n]ode .*dist/(src/)?main(\.js)?( |$)'
```

The ERE is regression-guarded by `npm run test:kill-backend`
(`scripts/kill-backend-pattern.test.sh`, also run in CI via
`.github/workflows/dev-scripts-smoke.yml`) — it asserts the pattern matches the real
prod/Docker/dev-watch signatures and never matches its own command line.

> **Caveat.** `kill-backend` targets detached `node` processes; a foreground
> `dev:single` / `nest start --watch` session should be stopped with Ctrl-C — if it
> keeps holding the port, the next boot can fail with `EADDRINUSE`. Separately, a
> `RUN_MODE=single` boot may still stop further down at the missing Kafka topic
> `journey_trigger_kafka_queue` (see EVO-1571 / EVO-1200) — that is independent of this
> fix.

## Architecture

Evo Flow is the automation layer between the user-facing Evo CRM and the underlying data plane:

```
                       ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                       │  evo-ai-frontend-community   │
                       │  (React + Vite SPA)          │
                       └────────────┬─────────────────┘
                                    │ Bearer token (issued by evo-auth)
                ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
                ↓                   ↓                   ↓
   evo-ai-crm-community     Evo Flow (you)     evo-auth-service-community
   (Rails, source-of-truth  (NestJS, journeys, (Rails, token issuance,
    for contacts/labels)    segments, events)  RBAC, MFA)
                │                   │
                │                   ├─→ Postgres (journeys/segments/campaigns)
                │                   ├─→ ClickHouse (events, segment state)
                │                   ├─→ Kafka (event bus, campaign batches)
                │                   ├─→ Redis (cache, throttling)
                │                   └─→ Temporal (workflow orchestration)
                ↓
            (REST reads)
```

Inter-service authentication uses Bearer tokens issued by `evo-auth-service-community`. Service-to-service calls use the `EVOAI_CRM_API_TOKEN` API key. No `account-id` header is required — account scoping is derived from JWT claims at the auth boundary.

## Observability — logs and metrics

### Structured logs

Every log record is emitted as a single JSON line to stdout, so a collector
(Loki / Datadog / `jq`) can parse it without grepping free text. Mandatory
fields on each record:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `service` | the running `RUN_MODE` (e.g. `event-receiver`) |
| `level` | `info` \| `warn` \| `error` \| `debug` \| `verbose` |
| `correlationId` | request correlation id (from the `X-Correlation-Id` header, propagated via `AsyncLocalStorage`); `null` outside a request |
| `campaignId` | present when the log relates to a campaign |
| `msg` | the message |
| `context` | the emitting class/component |

To trace a single request end-to-end, send an `X-Correlation-Id` and filter on it:

```bash
curl -H 'X-Correlation-Id: test-123' -X POST localhost:3000/webhooks/evolution-api -d '{}'
# then, in the service stdout:
... | jq 'select(.correlationId == "test-123")'
```

The logger never emits PII (recipient phone, email, template body) at `info`
level — those keys are redacted to `[REDACTED]`.

### Metrics (Prometheus)

Each HTTP-serving mode exposes a Prometheus scrape endpoint:

```bash
npm run dev:event-receiver   # the script already sets RUN_MODE=event-receiver
curl localhost:3000/metrics
```

Key metrics emitted per mode (`mode` label = `RUN_MODE`):

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `evo_flow_request_duration_seconds` | summary (`p50/p95/p99`) | request/processing latency |
| `evo_flow_errors_total{category}` | counter | errors by category (→ `error_rate` via `rate()`) |
| `evo_flow_throughput_total` | counter | units processed (→ throughput via `rate()`) |
| `evo_flow_consumer_lag{topic}` | gauge | consumer lag per topic/queue (consumer modes only) |
| `idempotency_hits_total` / `idempotency_misses_total` | counter | idempotency drops vs. first-sights (→ drop rate) |

> `consumer_lag` is populated by modes that consume from the broker. The
> `event-receiver` mode is a producer (it publishes webhooks), so the gauge is
> registered but stays unset there; real per-topic values appear on consumer
> modes (`event-process`, `campaign-sender`) once those are wired.
