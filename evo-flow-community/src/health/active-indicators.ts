/**
 * Indicators evaluated by `/ready` for a given RUN_MODE (EVO-1226):
 * Postgres + Redis + Broker for every mode, plus ClickHouse only for
 * `event-process` (AC4), plus the journey-execution queue-health probe only for
 * the dedicated `temporal-worker` (EVO-1764), plus a separate
 * Temporal-connectivity probe for the same mode (EVO-1859) so "Temporal
 * unreachable" and "queue has no worker" stay distinct readiness signals. Both
 * are deliberately NOT added in `single` mode: there the worker shares the
 * process with the API, so a journey-queue dip must not 503 the whole co-located
 * surface and risk LB eviction. SINGLE still gets the signal via the `/metrics`
 * poller gauges. Pure function so the gating is unit-testable without booting the
 * module graph.
